        With nearly two decades of experience as Director at Intelec Services, I
        have a proven track record of developing tailored software and
        hardware-based solutions using a variety of programming languages,
        including C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. Additionally, I
        possess a strong background in network administration, having
        successfully implemented numerous networking solutions for my clients.
        To continuously broaden my knowledge and skillset, I have pursued
        further education in the fields of electrical and mechanical
        engineering, as well as information technology, IT. This has allowed me
        to gain a comprehensive understanding of the industry and offer my
        clients a diverse range of services. Throughout my IT degree program, I

        with Java, while also refining my skills with C, C++, and JavaScript. As
        a passionate learner, I am always eager to tackle new challenges and
        recently taught myself React.js. I have built a portfolio of projects
        that are available for viewing and open-source use on my GitHub page,

        hands-on professional who thrives on taking on complex projects and
        enjoys working with new technologies.
